Hello and welcome to my development blog!

I'm excited to start this journey of sharing my experiences, learnings, and experiments in web development. This blog will be my space to document what I discover as I dive deeper into the world of JavaScript and modern web technologies.

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find posts about:

- **JavaScript**: Tips, tricks, and deep dives into the language I love
- **Deno**: Exploring this modern runtime and its ecosystem
- **Serverless**: Building scalable applications with serverless architectures
- **Web Development**: General web dev topics, tools, and best practices

## Why I'm Blogging

Writing about what I learn helps me:

1. **Solidify my understanding** - Teaching is one of the best ways to learn
2. **Document my journey** - It's useful to look back and see how far I've come
3. **Help others** - If my posts help even one person, it's worth it!

## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to connect with fellow developers. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sobanieca).

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful here!
