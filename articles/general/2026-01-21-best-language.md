"Which programming language should I bet my career on?"

Some time ago, a family member studying Computer Science asked me where he
should start deep diving to get the best return on their time. My answer was
immediate: **JavaScript.**

It is the language that is virtually everywhere. It allows you to build complex
UIs, robust backends, and even mobile apps. But my recommendation goes deeper
than just popularity. It is about how the philosophy of software development has
evolved.

### The Evolution of "Safety"

For many years, I was a dedicated .NET developer. In that era, a strongly typed
language wasn't just a preference; it was the only responsible choice.

Back then, we didn't have the luxury of modern CI/CD pipelines, extensive
unit/e2e testing suites, or rigorous Pull Request reviews. Often, deployment
meant manually dragging files onto an FTP server. In that high-risk environment,
the compiler was your primary line of defense. **If the code compiled, you were
almost certain it would work.**

But the landscape has shifted. Today, type checking is just one small layer in a
massive ecosystem of quality control. We have automated testing, linting, and
sophisticated deployment strategies. The strict "compiler safety" that was once
mandatory is now just one tool among many.

### Reducing Friction

In this new world, I have rediscovered the value of dynamic languages. They
allow to focus on logic, data flow, and architecture—not to fight with
configuration.

Tasks that used to take me hours to architect in .NET—like mocking complex
generic types for a test suite—are often trivial in JavaScript.

There is a velocity in JavaScript that is hard to beat. It removes the ceremony.
Of course, the old adage remains: _with great power comes great responsibility._
You must be disciplined.

### TypeScript

Here we cannot talk about JavaScript without addressing TypeScript. It has taken
the industry by storm, and for good reason.

I use TypeScript daily in my professional work. In large-scale enterprise
projects with dozens of contributors, it is valuable. It serves as living
documentation and helps navigate massive codebases.

However, when you are building your personal projects, you have limited time.
You want to see results. Adding a compilation step and complex type definitions
can sometimes slow down the "feedback loop."

### The AI Factor

There is a final, modern argument for prioritizing JavaScript as your starting
point: **Artificial Intelligence.**

In the past, we relied heavily on static types to help our IDEs understand our
code. Today, AI agents understand code context regardless of types. If I write a
function in plain JS, the AI can still write the unit tests, find the edge
cases, and suggest refactors.

In an AI-assisted world, the "safety layer" provided by static typing is no
longer the _only_ way to write correct code. The AI helps bridge that gap,
allowing you to focus on building features.
