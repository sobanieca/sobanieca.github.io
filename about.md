title: "About Me"

Hey there! I work as a software developer [@Redocly](www.redocly.com).

Since I remember I was fascinated with all devices that allowed me to write code
and that could fit in my pocket. I remember I've dreamed about
[Casio Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_Cassiopeia). I've had a
chance to use some of the [Palmtops](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmtop) with
Windows Mobile. On my Computer Science studies I've had a chance to play with
Nokia's Symbian OS phones. There, indeed I was able to SSH to my server and
write some simple scripts. It was rather awkward to write proper code on these
devices - it was more about some experimenting and playing.

It has all changed with modern smartphones. I use Android phones, so I've
installed [Termux](https://termux.dev) and there I could build anything (for
more heavy development remote server with Unix OS is needed).

This _hobby_ resulted in significant switch in my career. Instead of relying
heavily on Windows and extra heavy Visual Studio (do not confuse with Visual
Studio Code) I started to utilize more lightweight techologies - I've switched
to Debian OS (I still use Windows + WSL2), I've started using Neovim and Tmux.
It took me a long way to get here and that's why I've decided that it makes
sense to share some knowledge about this. I can see some interest from people
when they hear about option of using mobile phone as a development machine.
