For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with all kinds of pocket
PCs. I remember dreaming about
[Casio Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_Cassiopeia) as a kid.
I've had a chance to use some of the
[Palmtops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmtop) with Windows Mobile. During my
Computer Science studies I've had a chance to play with Nokia's Symbian OS
phones. They were pretty capable and gave me a chance to SSH into some Unix
servers and write simple scripts.

It has all evolved greatly with modern smartphones. You can install a terminal
emulator and use regular Linux tools - including Neovim(!). This, mixed with AI
agents (like Claude Code) allows one to stay productive truly anywhere. For many
this may sound ridiculous (coding on mobile phone?) but it's really possible.
Personally, I was able to make some significant contributions to some of my open
source projects being in various places where I would not have the possibility
to open a laptop. Even with AI agents doing much of the heavy lifting, there
will always be a need to have an IDE and terminal at hand to verify changes or
give more detailed instructions.

All this led me to create this page. I've spent a lot of time and
effort on fine-tuning my mobile/remote setup. I've even changed my career to be
able to code on my mobile phone! For many years I was a .NET developer and I was
working with regular Visual Studio (not to be confused with Visual Studio
Code!). This was heavy technology and not terminal friendly (although back in
the day it was very valuable). I will try to share my experience and inspire
some more people to try a similar path. I can see that people on various
developer groups keep asking how to interact with AI coding agents while away
from their computer. Hopefully I will be able to share some ways to do
this.
