# About Me

Hi, I'm sobanieca!

I'm a developer interested in everything related to JavaScript. Currently, I'm exploring:

- **Deno**: The modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- **Serverless**: Building scalable applications without managing infrastructure
- **Web Development**: Creating modern web applications with the latest technologies

This blog is my space to share what I learn, document my experiments, and hopefully help others on their development journey.

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sobanieca)!
