title: "About Me"

Hey there! I work as a software developer at [Redocly](https://www.redocly.com).

Since I remember I was fascinated with all devices that allowed me to write code
and that could fit in my pocket. I remember I've dreamed about
[Casio Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_Cassiopeia). I've had a
chance to use some of the [Palmtops](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmtop) with
Windows Mobile. On my Computer Science studies I've had a chance to play with
Nokia's Symbian OS phones. There, indeed I was able to SSH to my server and
write some simple scripts. It was rather awkward to write proper code on these
devices - it was more about some experimenting and playing.

It has all changed with modern smartphones. I use Android phones, so I've
installed [Termux](https://termux.dev) and there I could build anything (for
more heavy development remote server with Unix OS is needed).

This _hobby_ resulted in significant switch in my career. Instead of relying
heavily on Windows and extra heavy Visual Studio (do not confuse with Visual
Studio Code) I started to utilize more lightweight techologies - I've switched
to Debian OS (I still use Windows + WSL2), I've started using Neovim and Tmux.
All this to make 100% use of small screen of mobile phone. It took me a long way
to get here and that's why I've decided that it makes sense to share some
knowledge about this. I can see some interest from people when they hear about
option of using mobile phone as a development machine.

Nowadays, with AI, coding on mobile devices is closer than ever. It really feels
like superpowers and I can already see big interest in this in various places.
Some may say that we will reach a point where developers will only review PR's
written by AI. I don't agree with this. I still think we need proper tools to
navigate across code, check the structure created by AI etc. For this, still
some IDE will be needed. And if one wants to do it on mobile device - there is no
better way to make a full use of terminal.
