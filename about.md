For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with all kinds of pocket
PCs. I remember dreaming about
[Casio Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_Cassiopeia) as a kid.
I've had a chance to use some of the
[Palmtops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmtop) with Windows Mobile. During my
Computer Science studies I've had a chance to play with Nokia's Symbian OS
phones. They were pretty capable and gave me a chance to SSH into some Unix
servers and write simple scripts.

It has all evolved greatly with modern smartphones. You can install a terminal
emulator and use regular Linux tools - including Neovim(!). This, mixed with AI
agents (like Claude Code) allows one to stay productive truly anywhere. For many
this may sound ridiculous (coding on mobile phone?) but it's really possible.
Personally, I was able to make some significant contributions to some of my open
source projects being in various places where I would not have the possibility
to open a laptop. Some may say that we are moving towards direction where
software developers will only keep reviewing pull requests. I don't agree with
this. In my opinion there will be always a need to have some IDE and terminal at
hand to double check few things or give some more detailed instructions to LLMs.

That's why I have decided to create this page. I've spent a lot of time and
effort on fine-tuning my mobile/remote setup. I've even changed my career to be
able to code on my mobile phone! For many years I was a .NET developer and I was
working with regular Visual Studio (not to be confused with Visual Studio
Code!). This was heavy technology and not terminal friendly (although back in
the day it was very valuable). I will try to share my experience and inspire
some more people to try a similar path. I can see that people on various
developer groups keep asking about some way of synchronizing with their AI
agents. Hopefully I will be able to share some ways to do this.
