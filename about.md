For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with all kinds of pocket
PCs. I remember dreaming about
[Casio Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_Cassiopeia) as a kid.
I've had a chance to use some of the
[Palmtops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmtop) with Windows Mobile. During my
Computer Science studies I've had a chance to play with Nokia's Symbian OS
phones. They were pretty capable and gave me a chance to SSH into some Unix
servers and write simple scripts.

It has all evolved greatly with modern smartphones. You can install a terminal
emulator and use regular Linux tools - including Neovim(!). This, mixed with AI
agents (like Claude Code) allows one to stay productive truly anywhere. For many
this may sound ridiculous (coding on mobile phone?) but it's really possible.
Personally, I was able to make some significant contributions to some of my open
source projects being in various places where I would not have the possibility
to open a laptop. I believe that even with AI agents doing much of the heavy
lifting, there will still be a need to have an IDE and terminal at hand to
verify changes or give more detailed instructions.

All this led me to create this page. I've spent a lot of time and effort
fine-tuning my mobile/remote setup. Even before the AI revolution, I felt this
was a great way to work — so much that I've changed my career. For many years I
was a .NET developer working in Visual Studio (not to be confused with Visual
Studio Code!). It was a great technology back in the day, but many things have
changed.

Now, with AI coding assistants, ability to code on mobile phone feels like
superpowers. It's worth sharing! I can see that people on various developer
groups keep asking how to interact with AI coding agents while away from their
computer. Hopefully I will be able to help with that. And even if you can't
imagine using your mobile phone for development, there are other related topics
that might interest you — like coding on remote servers or using the terminal as
your primary development environment.
